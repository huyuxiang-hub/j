insitu-random-aligned-comparison-needs-to-exclude-reemission
===============================================================

Random aligned bi-simulation is only possible in highly controlled 
situations. Normally that means using common input photons, rather than
common input gensteps. 

Suspect that full insitu random aligned will be stymied by reemission. 
However that does not prevent alignment of photons that 
do not undergo reemission as the random streams for each photon
are treated separately.  

The random-aligned comparison of a subset of photons  
is still useful and worth reviving however.
