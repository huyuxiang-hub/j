Dear Alberto, PC members and collaborators,

     We prepared a paper draft about PMT optical model, please find it in attachment and also in DocDB:
     https://juno.ihep.ac.cn/cgi-bin/Dev_DocDB/ShowDocument?docid=7643 
     The studies we conducted are of general interests in some PMT-based applications and no much JUNO details involved in this work, even though it is inpsired by JUNO needs.
     To me, it looks that this paper draft is more like a general paper than a JUNO paper.
     Alberto, could you please advise me the paper category and procedures that we need to follow in next steps?
     For any cases, we would like to collect comments and suggestions from our collaborators, they are highly appreciated.

Best Wishes,
Guofu and Yaoguang, on behalf of authors
